### Why splitting the code is useful

Splitting code into multiple files improves readability, maintainability, and reusability. 
By separating the function definitions (`production_functions.py`) from the testing and evaluation code (`production_evaluations.py`), 
it becomes easier to debug, update, and reuse the functions in other projects. 
This structure also follows good programming practice, especially in larger projects where organization is important.
